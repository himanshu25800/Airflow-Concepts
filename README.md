Apache Airflow: Internal Architecture and Operations
Introduction
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for orchestrating complex computational workflows and data processing pipelines. This document provides a deep technical exploration of Airflow’s internal architecture, focusing on its core components, task execution, scheduling mechanisms, DAG parsing, and optimization strategies for scalability and performance.
Core Components of Airflow
Airflow’s architecture is modular, comprising several key components that interact to manage and execute workflows. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component and their interactions.
Scheduler
The Scheduler is the heart of Airflow, responsible for:

Parsing DAG files to identify tasks and dependencies.
Scheduling tasks based on their dependencies, triggers, and defined schedules.
Monitoring task execution and updating task states in the metadata database.

Internals:

The Scheduler runs as a standalone process, continuously polling the DAG directory for changes.
It uses a DagFileProcessor to parse DAG files, creating DagRun objects for each execution cycle.
It leverages the metadata database to track DagRun and TaskInstance states.

Interaction:

Communicates with the Metadata Database to store and retrieve task states.
Sends tasks to the Executor for execution.
Interacts with the Web Server to provide status updates.

Web Server
The Web Server provides a user interface for monitoring and managing DAGs, tasks, and their execution history.
Internals:

Built using Flask, it serves the Airflow UI, rendering DAG graphs, task logs, and execution metrics.
Queries the Metadata Database to display task states and historical data.
Supports RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for user management.

Interaction:

Reads from the Metadata Database to display real-time and historical data.
Communicates with the Scheduler indirectly via the database to trigger manual DAG runs or task retries.

Worker
Workers execute the tasks assigned by the Scheduler.
Internals:

Workers are typically managed by an Executor (e.g., Celery or Kubernetes).
Each worker process runs tasks in isolated environments (e.g., subprocesses or containers).
Workers pull task execution details from the Executor and update task states in the Metadata Database.

Interaction:

Receives task instructions from the Executor.
Updates task states in the Metadata Database.
May interact with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs) as defined in task logic.

Metadata Database
The Metadata Database is a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) that stores:

DAG definitions and configurations.
Task and DAG run states (TaskInstance, DagRun).
Historical execution logs and metadata.

Internals:

Uses SQLAlchemy for ORM-based database interactions.
Maintains tables like dag, task_instance, dag_run, and xcom for state management.
Critical for ensuring consistency and fault tolerance across components.

Interaction:

Used by the Scheduler to store and retrieve DAG and task states.
Queried by the Web Server for UI rendering.
Updated by Workers to reflect task execution outcomes.

Executor
The Executor determines how tasks are executed. Airflow supports multiple executors, each with distinct characteristics:

LocalExecutor: Runs tasks as subprocesses on the same machine as the Scheduler.
CeleryExecutor: Distributes tasks to a pool of workers via a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis).
KubernetesExecutor: Runs each task in a dedicated Kubernetes pod.
DaskExecutor: Leverages Dask for distributed task execution.

Internals:

The Executor interfaces with the Scheduler to queue and manage task execution.
It handles resource allocation, task isolation, and fault tolerance.

Interaction:

Receives tasks from the Scheduler.
Delegates tasks to Workers or other execution environments.
Updates the Metadata Database with task execution results.

Task Execution, Scheduling, and DAG Parsing
Airflow’s task execution and scheduling mechanisms are tightly coupled with its DAG parsing process. Below is a detailed explanation of these processes at both the system and code levels.
Task Execution
Tasks are defined within DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) using operators (e.g., PythonOperator, BashOperator). The execution flow is as follows:

Task Queuing:
The Scheduler identifies tasks ready to run based on their dependencies and schedule intervals.
Tasks are queued in the Executor’s task queue (e.g., Celery’s message broker or Kubernetes API).


Task Execution:
A Worker retrieves the task from the queue.
The task’s operator executes the defined logic (e.g., running a Python function or SQL query).
Results are stored in the Metadata Database or passed via XCom for inter-task communication.


State Updates:
The Worker updates the task’s state (running, success, failed) in the Metadata Database.
The Scheduler monitors these updates to trigger downstream tasks.



Code-Level Insight:

The BaseOperator class defines the execute method, which is overridden by specific operators.

Example for PythonOperator:
def execute(self, context):
    return self.python_callable(*self.op_args, **self.op_kwargs)


The Executor calls task_instance.run() to execute the task, which invokes the operator’s execute method.


Scheduling
The Scheduler uses a loop-based polling mechanism to manage task scheduling:

DAG Discovery:
The Scheduler scans the DAG directory (dags_folder) for Python files.
Each file is processed by DagFileProcessor to instantiate DAG objects.


DagRun Creation:
For each DAG, the Scheduler creates a DagRun based on the schedule_interval (e.g., @daily, cron expressions).
The DagRun represents a single execution cycle of the DAG.


Task Scheduling:
The Scheduler evaluates task dependencies using the DAG’s topology.
Tasks with satisfied dependencies are marked as scheduled and sent to the Executor.



Code-Level Insight:

The SchedulerJob class implements the main scheduling loop:
def _execute(self):
    self._process_dags()
    self._schedule_dagruns()
    self._process_task_instances()


Dependency evaluation uses the DAG.get_task_instances method to check task states.


DAG Parsing
DAG parsing is a critical process that impacts Airflow’s performance, especially in high-scale environments.
Process:

File Scanning:
The Scheduler periodically scans the DAG directory for new or modified Python files.
Controlled by dag_dir_list_interval configuration (default: 5 minutes).


DAG Instantiation:
Each Python file is imported as a module.
The DagFileProcessor executes the module to instantiate DAG objects.


DAG Serialization:
Parsed DAGs are serialized to the Metadata Database (if dag_serialization is enabled).
This reduces parsing overhead by caching DAG structures.



Performance Implications:

Parsing Overhead: Parsing large numbers of DAGs or complex DAG files can strain the Scheduler, especially if files contain heavy computations or external API calls.
Memory Usage: Each DAG file is loaded into memory, increasing resource consumption with scale.
I/O Bottlenecks: Frequent file system access can slow down parsing in environments with many DAGs.

Code-Level Insight:

The DagFileProcessor.process_file method handles DAG parsing:
def process_file(self, file_path):
    mod = importlib.import_module(file_path)
    dags = [dag for dag in mod.__dict__.values() if isinstance(dag, DAG)]
    return dags


Serialization uses the SerializedDagModel to store DAG structures in the database.


Static vs. Dynamic DAGs
Airflow supports both static and dynamic DAGs, with significant differences in how they are defined and processed.
Static DAGs

Definition: DAGs defined explicitly in Python files with fixed task structures.

Example:
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG('static_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(task_id='task1', python_callable=lambda: print("Task 1"))
    task2 = PythonOperator(task_id='task2', python_callable=lambda: print("Task 2"))
    task1 >> task2


Processing: Parsed once during DAG discovery and stored in memory or the database.

Use Case: Workflows with predictable, unchanging structures.


Dynamic DAGs

Definition: DAGs generated programmatically at runtime, often based on external data (e.g., database queries, configuration files).

Example:
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def generate_dag(dag_id, tasks):
    with DAG(dag_id, start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
        for task_name in tasks:
            PythonOperator(task_id=task_name, python_callable=lambda: print(f"Running {task_name}"))
    return dag

tasks = ['task1', 'task2', 'task3']
globals()[f'dynamic_dag'] = generate_dag('dynamic_dag', tasks)


Processing:

Dynamic DAGs are generated during DAG parsing, requiring execution of the Python code that defines them.
The Scheduler re-evaluates the DAG definition on each parse cycle, increasing overhead.
Stored in the Metadata Database like static DAGs, but their dynamic nature may lead to frequent updates.


Use Case: Workflows that vary based on runtime conditions (e.g., processing multiple datasets with similar logic).


Internal Handling:

Dynamic DAGs are treated as regular DAGs once instantiated.
The DagFileProcessor executes the Python code to generate the DAG object, which is then serialized or cached.
Frequent re-parsing of dynamic DAGs can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if the generation logic involves heavy computations.

Best Practices for Scalable and Efficient Dynamic DAGs
To optimize dynamic DAGs for scalability and performance, consider the following strategies:
Reducing Parsing Time

Minimize File I/O:

Reduce the number of DAG files by consolidating related workflows into fewer files.
Use dag_serialization to cache DAG structures in the Metadata Database, reducing the need for repeated parsing.


Optimize DAG Generation Logic:

Avoid expensive operations (e.g., database queries, API calls) during DAG parsing.
Cache external data used for DAG generation in a fast storage layer (e.g., Redis) to avoid repeated fetches.


Lazy Loading:

Use Python’s functools.partial or custom wrappers to defer heavy computations until task execution.

Example:
from functools import partial

def expensive_computation(data):
    # Simulate heavy computation
    return len(data)

with DAG('lazy_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)) as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='lazy_task',
        python_callable=partial(expensive_computation, data=['a', 'b', 'c'])
    )





Avoiding Unnecessary DAG Instantiation

Conditional DAG Generation:

Use environment variables or configuration files to control which DAGs are generated.

Example:
import os
from airflow import DAG

if os.getenv('ENABLE_DAG') == 'true':
    with DAG('conditional_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)) as dag:
        task = PythonOperator(task_id='task', python_callable=lambda: print("Enabled"))




DAG Factory Pattern:

Use a factory function to generate DAGs, centralizing logic and reducing code duplication.

Example:
def dag_factory(dag_id, task_list):
    with DAG(dag_id, start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)) as dag:
        for task_name in task_list:
            PythonOperator(task_id=task_name, python_callable=lambda: print(task_name))
    return dag

for i in range(3):
    globals()[f'dag_{i}'] = dag_factory(f'dag_{i}', [f'task_{j}' for j in range(3)])





Using Jinja Templating Efficiently

Leverage Jinja for Dynamic Parameters:

Use Jinja templates to pass runtime parameters to tasks, reducing the need for dynamic DAG generation.

Example:
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

with DAG('templated_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)) as dag:
    task = BashOperator(
        task_id='templated_task',
        bash_command='echo {{ dag_run.conf.get("param", "default") }}'
    )




Avoid Overuse:

Limit Jinja templating to task parameters rather than entire DAG structures to minimize parsing overhead.
Cache frequently used templates to avoid redundant rendering.



Leveraging TaskFlow API and XCom in Dynamic Contexts

TaskFlow API:

Use the TaskFlow API to simplify task dependencies and data passing in dynamic DAGs.

Example:
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from datetime import datetime

@dag(start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily')
def dynamic_taskflow_dag():
    @task
    def generate_data():
        return ['data1', 'data2']

    @task
    def process_data(data):
        return [f"Processed {d}" for d in data]

    data = generate_data()
    processed = process_data(data)

globals()['dynamic_taskflow_dag'] = dynamic_taskflow_dag()




XCom for Data Sharing:

Use XCom to pass data between tasks in dynamic DAGs, especially when task outputs are needed downstream.

Optimize XCom usage by limiting data size (e.g., store large datasets in external storage and pass references).

Example:
@task
def store_data():
    return {'key': 'value'}

@task
def retrieve_data(data):
    print(data['ーム'])

data = store_data()
retrieve_data(data)





Optimization Techniques for High-Scale Environments
In environments with large numbers of DAGs, high parallelism, or extensive worker scaling, the following optimizations are critical:
DAG-Level Optimizations

Reduce DAG Complexity:

Minimize the number of tasks per DAG to reduce dependency evaluation overhead.
Break large DAGs into smaller, modular DAGs triggered via TriggerDagRunOperator.


Use SubDAGs Sparingly:

SubDAGs increase parsing and scheduling overhead. Prefer TaskGroup for logical grouping without additional DAGs.

Example:
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

with DAG('grouped_dag', start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)) as dag:
    with TaskGroup('group1') as tg1:
        task1 = PythonOperator(task_id='task1', python_callable=lambda: print("Task 1"))
        task2 = PythonOperator(task_id='task2', python_callable=lambda: print("Task 2"))
        task1 >> task2





Scheduler Optimizations

Enable DAG Serialization:
Set store_serialized_dags = True in airflow.cfg to cache DAGs in the database.
Reduces parsing overhead but increases database load.


Tune Scheduler Parameters:
Adjust scheduler_heartbeat_sec to balance responsiveness and resource usage.
Increase num_runs in DagFileProcessor for faster DAG processing in high-scale environments.


High Availability (HA) Mode:
Run multiple Scheduler instances with a shared Metadata Database for fault tolerance.
Use scheduler_max_tries to limit retry attempts and prevent deadlocks.



Worker and Executor Optimizations

Scale Workers Dynamically:

Use auto-scaling with CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor to match worker count to task demand.
Configure worker_concurrency to optimize task throughput per worker.


Optimize Resource Allocation:

For KubernetesExecutor, define resource requests and limits in pod templates to prevent over-provisioning.

Example:
executor_config:
  pod_template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: airflow-worker
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "1Gi"
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "2Gi"





Database Optimizations

Use a Robust Database:

Prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL for better concurrency and performance.
Ensure the database is properly indexed (e.g., on task_instance, dag_run tables).


Clean Up Old Data:

Schedule regular cleanup of old TaskInstance and DagRun records using airflow db cleanup.

Example cron job:
0 0 * * * airflow db cleanup --clean-before-timestamp "$(date -d '-30 days')"





Executor Choices and Their Impact
The choice of Executor significantly affects Airflow’s architecture and performance. Below is a comparison of common Executors:

Implemented via SmartSensorOperator.


Benefits:
Reduces resource usage for long-running wait tasks.
Improves worker efficiency in high-scale environments.


Trade-Offs:
Requires additional configuration and monitoring.
Limited to specific use cases (e.g., external triggers).
